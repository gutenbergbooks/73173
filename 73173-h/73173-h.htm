<h1>EINSTEIN'S PLANETOID</h1>

<p><span class='it'>An Engrossing Tale of An Incredible World</span></p>

<p class="ph1">by PAUL DENNIS LAVOND</p>

<p>(Author of “Something from Beyond,” “A Prince of Pluto,” etc.)</p>

<p>Paul Dennis Lavond is a pseudonym known to be used by three different authors:
C. M. Kornbluth, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and Frederick Pohl.</p>

<p><span class='it'>They were the heirs of space-flight: They planned to be the first humans to land on
Alpha Centauri, but the original Hartnett expedition had been lost and they had to
find it first. They followed the signals and found that they led to what looked like a
one-way excursion to the screwiest planetoid in the galaxy!</span></p>

<p>[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from
Science Fiction Quarterly Spring 1942.]</p>
</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<div><h2>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HEIRS OF SPACE FLIGHT</span></h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Nick Hartnett stepped
off the upper lip of the
thousand-foot shaft and
floated gently downwards. When he
had fallen about half the distance,
he reached out for a stanchion,
grasped it easily and pulled himself
gracefully into the lounge-room of
the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he saw there was precisely
what he expected to see. There was
Dorothy Gilbert, curled in a spring-hammock,
reading a book. Nick was
looking over’ her shoulder before she
knew he had entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bodie’s ‘Parecliptic Orbits,’ ” he
read aloud. “Dorothy, don’t you ever
think of anything but your job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up, smiling, brushing
aside a lock of tousled hair that
sought her eye. “Often, Nick. But
where would we be if I didn’t check
my courses against those plotted by
a competent authority?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just about where we’ll be if you
do,” he guessed, tugging at his ear
with long, knobby fingers. “You’re
my idea of a competent authority
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Nick. How are the contracels
holding out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderfully!” he grinned. “It
seems as if my father did a fair job
of inventing there—though maybe
not quite good enough.” He knelt
and touched a button inset in the
floor; instantly the metallic luster of
it dulled and clouded, then the clouds
seemed to vanish as the floor became
transparent. In an instant it appeared
to have vanished entirely, revealing
an immense sweep of blackness
interspersed with white-hot, tiny
specks of light that were stars and
planets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick stared out at them. The whole
field of stars was moving, it seemed,
though, in actuality, it was the ship
itself that spun on its axis, providing
them with the illusion of gravity
they required. It was hard for Hartnett
to realize that this view was almost
brand-new to human eyes, that
only twenty or thirty people could
ever have seen stars and the solar
system from this vantage point, outside
the plane of the ecliptic. There
were seven persons in the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>
now, and there had been eighteen or
twenty in its predecessor which had
been reported lost some years before.
Those two ships, the only ones in the
System’s great armada to be equipped
with the counter-acceleration devices
that made it possible to venture out
of the confines of the Solar System,
were also the only ones to leave the
plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Earth?” Nick asked absently
without looking up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy closed the book on a finger
and leaned over the edge of the hammock
to look. “It’s not in sight now,”
she said. “Wait until we spin a
little farther. Of course, I can’t
guarantee you’ll be able to see it then,
either, because the ship may hide
it. But we’ll see. We’re looking out
one side of the ship and Earth is directly
in back of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snapped off the vision and the
floor returned to normal. “As soon
as we get the reports from the two
goops,” he mused, “we can start making
definite plans for the outing.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“We heard you,” came a voice
from just outside the
lounge, and, a second later, Bob Vickers
appeared, climbing hand-over-hand
against the slight pull of the
acceleration that managed to seep
through the not-quite-perfect guard
of the contracels. He pulled himself
into the lounge and turned back, extending
a hand to Fred Marquis, who
followed him in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two glared at Nick with injured
expressions. “So this,” stated
Vickers sadly, “is how you refer to
your loyal aides behind their backs.”
He turned to Marquis: “Colleague,
we may as well tear up that paper
and save ourselves further humiliation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy Gilbert closed her book
with a snap. “Far be it from me to
poke my pretty nose into your little
brawls, but haven’t you two been
rather long in getting the data?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marquis made a sweeping bow.
“Fair lady,” he replied softly, “I appeal
to your innate sense of justice
and fair play. Did or did not our
noble captain, on two occasions, call
us all away from our gruelling labor
to strain our ears trying to hear an
alleged distress signal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy laughed gaily, shaking
her hair away from her forehead.
“Indeed, our noble captain did. Not
only was your invaluable time wasted,
but mine as well. I was rechecking
the course and had to start from
scratch after the interruption.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lady is as gracious as she is
charming,” bowed Vickers. He faced
Nick. “We will be generous, sir, and
accept your apology.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ship’s company,” sighed Nick,
“is reminded that the original Hartnett
expedition was not entirely lost.
It is to be assumed that they are still
trying to contact someone, us in particular.
Thus the careful attention to
what appeared to be distress signals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now may I suggest that you save
your precious time by letting me
know what you found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” murmured Marquis to
Vickers, “is as close to an apology as
he’ll ever get.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Marquis unrolled a small chart,
holding it so both Dorothy and
Nick could see. “This,” he explained,
“you can check at your leisure,
though I’m a monkey’s uncle if you
find anything wrong with it. To sum
it up briefly, the <span class='it'>Columbia</span> is not only
the largest space-ship ever made but
also the fastest and most powerful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very nice,” replied Nick, “but that
alone isn’t good enough. We can still
be the fastest thing aspace and not
be capable of a voyage to Alpha Centauri
and back within the span of
a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this is correct,” interrupted
Dorothy, jabbing at an equation with
her index finger, “then we can do
it easily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too damn bad,” mused Nick,
“that my father was so secretive
about things. Whatever it is we
have here, I’ll bet he had just as
good—if not better—on the Orion
ten years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t he leave any notes?” asked
Vickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None. Apparently he feared their
falling into the wrong hands in case
anything happened to him. The only
thing he did leave was wave n, the
one he promised to use for communications.
That’s what the contracel
formula came over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s nose wrinkled in puzzlement.
“I was under the impression,”
she said, “that the contracel formula
was radioed to Earth mysteriously—only
it was badly garbled, just fractions
coming through. And you,
Nick, were the only one who could
make anything out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partly true,” he admitted. “The
‘mysterious’ radio message however
was something I cooked up to keep
the newspapers satisfied. I wanted
to let out the publicity that the Hartnett
expedition wasn’t completely
done in, but I didn’t want to draw
attention to wave n. The fewer people
who know it exists, the better.
If I hadn’t thrown them offtrack
with a little hocus-pocus, the secret
might be out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vickers blinked. “Excuse me,” he
put in—“in this case, I guess I am
a goop. But can you explain the contracel
to me? I never really got
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no better off,” grinned Nick.
“I managed to get enough data from
the radio so as to know how to throw
the thing together, but as to precisely
what it does and why I can only
guess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I’d rather not get out
on a limb on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I know is this: interstellar
travel, to be anything at all, requires
really tremendous speed. To get that
speed you have to accelerate like hell.
And human bodies aren’t equipped to
take the acceleration required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what Dad did was to figure
out a counter-acceleration device,
which he called the ‘contracel’ for
short. All I know is that it blankets
the effects of really terrific acceleration
so far as our feeling it goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any idea, Nick,” asked
Dorothy Gilbert, suddenly serious,
“where the Hartnett party is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “They were
outward bound for Alpha Centauri,
just as we’ll be after we get home
and check these results. I’ve no idea
how far they got, because I don’t
know how to check distances by wave
n. In fact, I don’t think it can be
done; the damned thing doesn’t
travel right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Dorothy, and Bob, Edgar,
and I are all members of the family
of the original Hartnett expedition.
The reason I wanted you three was
because I really expect to look for
Dad and his friends on our way to
Alph. You. Fred, and Grenville and
Timbie aren’t exactly family members
in our little circle, but you’re
next thing to it. We’ll have to have
a bigger crew for the outing, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy ran her fingers through
her hair. “It’s been over twelve
years since I last saw Harry,” she
whispered. “I wonder what he looks
like now?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Joe Timbie was sucking laboriously
on a water-tube as they
pulled themselves into the control
room. He laid it aside at their entrance,
and wiped his face furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The interference is terrific,” he
began, “but I sounded the alarm because
I’m definitely getting something
every now and then, although
it’s hard to say what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any idea as to the source?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know how wave n is. Edgar’s
been cooped up in his cage for about
seven hours now, and, if he survives,
I damn well think he’ll have taken
wave n to pieces and put it together
again. Then we’ll know how to trace
the signals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy Gilbert sat on a bench
swinging her legs thoughtfully.
“How’s the intensity, Joe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timbie clutched his hair. “O
gawd!” he groaned. “It just shouldn’t
happen to a dog. This wave has the
most unholy variations ever conceived
by Lucifer. You remember how it
was on Earth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah,” agreed Nick. “Pretty wavy
to say the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well it’s all of that here—only
the little jigger has got itself another
twist. Not only does the intensity
vary according to no laws whatsoever,
but every now and then, she
comes through full blast, sans interference,
backwards!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” There was a chorus on
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard rightly. I used to
have a hobby back on Terra. Super-imposition
of recordings. I’d take
several records of music, and play
them simultaneously, working in
various others now and then and
thus make a new recording. At
times I’d run them in backwards,
lyrics and all. So, after awhile, I
got pretty accustomed to hearing
common English words spoken backwards.
And damned if some of the
apparently garbled signals didn’t
sound familiar until suddenly it
struck me. I was just beginning
to set them down when, whup! in
comes the interference, then they’re
straight again, but so faint I can’t
make them out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe,” called Dorothy softly, “are
they always in reverse when they’re
strong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—yes, they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Edgar know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slid off the table. “I think I’d
better tell him before he wastes any
more time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold it a moment,” protested
Nick. “I want to see if we can get
anything. Is the power on, Joe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah. Apparently they stopped
just an instant after I rang you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any idea when they might be on
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought to be a few minutes, Nick.
I’ve found that they apparently repeat
each broadcast three times with
a few hours interval between units of
three.” He shoved a slip of paper
over to Nick. “Here’s what I’ve managed
to make out so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick picked it up frowning. “Hmm—not
much here—it reads ‘horribly
warped by effects of motion’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then
there’s a blank—‘had to stay and one’—damn,
another blank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where it either faded out
or interference came in,” explained
Joe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. This is where it reversed,
eh? ‘Left and I am’ blank space
‘too slight to lift.’ That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose,” asked Marquis,
“that the phrase ‘left and I am’ might
mean that the person sending the
signals is the only one left and he’s
about at his rope’s end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” suggested Bob Vickers,
“something happened to the crew as
a result of their acceleration. ‘Horribly
warped by effects of motion’
sounds ominous. Perhaps the crew
went bats and they had to land to
save the ship. Then something happened
to them on the planet so that
they ‘had to stay and one’—well,
maybe he’s telling about the ghastly
fate of one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what about ‘too slight to
lift’?” reminded Fred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I recall,” said Nick in hushed
tones, “there was one outstanding
bad point about Dad’s setup. The
contracel controls were pretty heavy
and it took a strong man to work
them alone. If but one man were
on the ship, and he sick, or weak
from hunger, he couldn’t lift those
levers.” He stared a moment, then
added, “Particularly if the gravity on
whatever planet the ship is were
greater than that of Earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought the controls were automatic,”
protested Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were. But Dad had manual
controls installed just in case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point a wild-eyed, disheveled
figure burst in upon them.
“I’ve found them,” he cried in a high,
strained falsetto. “They’re in a tight
little orbit around Proxima Centauri.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy Gilbert took his arm.
“Come with me,” she whispered. “I
have some more data for you; you’ve
done wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two left the room, heads close
together. An instant later a faint
shriek reached the ears of those in
the control room, followed by gibbering
noises. Nick made a dive for the
exit, to find Edgar cackling faintly
to himself as Dorothy led him away.
“There, there,” she soothed, “it
wasn’t your fault. Now you just go
and get a nice long rest, then we’ll
help you with the new calculations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>INCREDIBLE WORLD</span></h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” exclaimed
Dorothy wearily,
planking down a sheaf
of motors. “If you can follow
through on this, Joe, we’ll find the
missing. We keep on straight ahead,
at right angles to Earth’s ecliptic.”
She closed her eyes. “Did you know,”
she murmured to no one in particular,
“that Edgar’s secret ambition is
to purr like a cat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he?” asked Nick anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a drunken stupor. After all
he’s been through I didn’t have the
heart to say no to him. So he emptied
an almost full bottle of the rocket
blast.” She beamed at Nick. “Edgar
has a special name for each grade
of alcoholate we distill; this is the
stiff one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to make some more
of that,” declared Marquis. “Heigh
ho, it’s back to the primitive. Y’know,
scientists are pretty sure that savages
spend most of their ingenuity
in figuring out ways to make better
and still better hooch. Disgusting,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang on to your stanchions,”
yelled Timbie as he pressed a button
which would send a warning
signal throughout the ship, “we’re
accelerating.” Instinctively they
obeyed. Without the contracels, they
would have been an obscene mass of
mangled protoplasm in the seconds
that followed; as it was, they experienced
something like the feeling
one obtains on the downward sweep
of a stiff roller coaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep a close check on the direction,
Joe,” grated Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impact of acceleration did not
last long, but it was some five minutes
before they really felt normal
again. Timbie bent over calculations,
a frown working its way across his
forehead. “I don’t like the way this
is working out,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Following Edgar’s equations?”
asked Dorothy, picking up the sheet.
She glanced over them quickly.
“Nothing wrong here only—jeepers,
you’re right, Joe! Stop the bus,
quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?” demanded Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—except that we’ve
passed them. They’re behind us
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timbie’s hands flew over the controls
rapidly. “Some day, after the
contracel principle has really been
perfected, we’re going to have ships
that are practically without inertia
so long as the power’s on. Ships
that can stop dead like that without
any terrifying results and go back
the way they came as neat as the
ancient’s trains on their tracks. But
we have to decelerate slowly or we’re
basket cases, if anybody ever finds
us at all.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Wherever they are,”
mused Nick, “it’s going to
be one sweet job finding the planetoid
in this space. It’ll be practically invisible
because of the distance from
the sun. We may go by it a couple
of times.” He jabbed a call button
sharply then spoke into a mike.
“Grenville? What’s doing? Oh, you
are!” He turned to the others. “Our
chemical engineer is turning his inventive
genius to a superior blend
of the rocket blast. How lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble pastime,” put in Dorothy.
“The last batch was pretty raw—I
think it would have dissolved my
teeth if I hadn’t swallowed it quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” yelped Nick. “Lay off
the monkey business for a minute
and attend. Hop down to the observation
room and look for a small
planetoid—I don’t know—could be
any port. Use maximum magnification
because it may be small—oh,
big enough to hold a ship about this
size perhaps. Possibly—quite probably
dark. Signal us as soon as you
see something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he’s been sampling his wares,
he’s likely to see anything,” suggested
Marquis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That being the case,” replied
Nick, “you’d better go down and
help him, all of you. It’s a tough
job for one man in any condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coming?” inquired Marquis of
Dorothy. She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yaaah!” he jibed. “Captain’s
pet!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy bit her lip. “When I
think that we almost went
right by it without suspecting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. almost
missed it completely, I
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick clasped her shoulder, his eyes
fixed upon the almost invisible
planetoid slowly growing before them.
“Were you and your brother—very
good friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarcely knew him,” she murmured.
“He ran away from home
when I was seven or eight, and we
only saw him once in awhile after
that. I think it was nearly six years
after he first hit out before he came
back. He was mature then and I
was just a silly adolescent, but I
idolized him because he was so famous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He spent nearly a whole month
with me—with us, that is—about
four years before he signed up with
your father. But all that seems unreal
now. If he’s—still alive, I’ll
probably say ‘hello, Harry,’ and kiss
him with sisterly affection and be
glad he’s all right, but it won’t really
mean much. What about your father,
Nick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned. “Dad and I were
pretty close. Matter of fact, I never
called him ‘dad’ until after he disappeared.
It was always Steve. He
preferred that; didn’t like his own
name, though I didn’t know about it
for a long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never could figure out the relationships
between the other kids I
knew and their parents. I always felt
sorry for them; you see, Steve explained
to me once—it’s amazing that
I got it the first time—that ‘father’
or ‘dad’ or ‘pop’ was something I’d
better call him when other people
were around just for the sake of appearances.
And, when I was in
school, why he was ‘my father.’ But
when we were alone together—or
just the three of us, Steve, Mater,
and I—we didn’t have to be formal
at all. We were always the best of
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew closer to him. “I’d like
to meet—Steve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her as if it were the
first time they were meeting. “Steve
would like you, too,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The alarm clanged for some time
before they noticed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry!” exclaimed Timbie as he
came into the room. “We’ve spotted
it. It’s less than 500 miles in diameter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He eased himself into the control
seat and started to shift them into
the proper curve for landing. Fascinated,
the three stared out the
large port at the rapidly increasing
globe before them. Unbroken in surface,
it loomed before, a seemingly
fantastic and impossible thing, a perfect
sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, prodigiously slow, they approached,
coasting gracefully, for
inertia or no, there was still the great
mass of the ship to take into consideration.
There was something
wrong about this—somewhere—then,
suddenly, the same thought
struck all three of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a sphere!” voiced Nick.
“It just looks that way because of its
tremendous speed of rotation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy wheeled out the z-special
camera and turned on the power, let
it operate for a full minute. Quietly
they waited for the automatic developing
process, then cut the lights
and flashed a projection on the panel
in the rear of the room which was
ideally suitable for a motion-picture
screen. Eyes glued on the meters,
Dorothy adapted the flow of film until
the images of the planetoid on the
panel corresponded to what they saw
outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the period of rotation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“100 per minute. That, to put
it mildly, is fast. It must be extremely
dense to hang together at all—and
even then, made of ultracohesive
matter.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>As Joe put it some time later,
the business of landing on
Hastur (as the planetoid came to be
known, Marquis first dubbed it that
after some legendary, elemental wind-being;
they found out later that
Hastur wasn’t really the being Fred
had in mind, but it stuck nonetheless)
was roughly analogous to that
of a fly lighting on a spinning top.
There was Hastur looming before
them in the deeps of space, gleaming
like phosphor on black velvet, the
pseudosphere of it slowly swelling before
their eyes. And there was the
<span class='it'>Columbia</span>, a great overgrown cylinder
with a turret in the middle—a turret
that completely encircled her, because
she spun, too,—albeit slowly in
comparison to the planetoid—gently
curving in to try to light upon the
little world’s surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened? They should
have known, but they didn’t. The
<span class='it'>Columbia</span> swooped down upon Hastur,
like the proverbial falcon upon its
prey. Only it wasn’t as simple as
that, because the ship touched the
outer fringe of that terrifically-accelerated
rotating atmosphere and
bounced off, ricocheted much like a
smooth stone splatting across the surface
of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They weren’t ready for that splat.
It took them unaware and tumbled
them all head-over. Luck was with
them and no one slammed into anything
sharp or deadly hard. Dorothy
nursed Nick’s bloody nose and a cut
over Marquis’ eye which just missed
being serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second time they tried it, it
was with less elan and more caution.
They figured that if they could cut
in at a point, cut in at an angle so
close to zero that they were virtually
parallel to it, slip in like a hypodermic
with the grain, so to speak, they
might be able to make it. It was
a nice idea but it didn’t work. They
were knocked away again. Only this
time all hands were prepared and no
casualties followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about then Edgar staggered in
wanting to know what was. Briefly
they told him. Edgar was amazed.
He stood there gaping at them, at,
he said, their innocence. Then he
raised his hands. “Friends,” quoth
Edgar, “like little children shall I
lead you. Land at the pole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s odd, isn’t it?” mused Dorothy
as Nick helped her up an
escarpment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s odd?” Edgar wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, despite the terrific rotation
of Hastur, we just don’t notice it
now that we’re here. I know why
of course. Sheer relativity. But it’s
still odd, no matter how well you explain
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” mused Edgar. “The
most common way is that of picturing
a caterpillar crawling down the
vane of a fan toward the center. The
fan is rotating at terrific speed; the
fan is on an express liner which is
zipping through Earth’s stratosphere
like nobody’s business; the stratosphere
is following Earth’s rotation,
and so on. Yet our caterpillar isn’t
conscious of any motion save his
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood silent for a moment,
surveying the scene before them.
Curving horizons could be seen on all
sides, the uneven terrain before them
now and then pierced by upcroppings
of rock. Or perhaps metals. Above
them no sky but space, dotted with
luminaries. Far away a splotch of
brightness—their sun. A world of
twilight, this was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind them lay their ship, a faintly
gleaming cylinder, badly scraped
and somewhat battered from landing.
They’d prepared a sort of berth by
splashing the terrain before them
with blasts from the emergency
rocket tubes, fore and aft, but the
landing had still been rough, not the
kind which would leave a ship in full
dress paint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere before them, precisely
how far they could not know, was the
lost Orion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” mused Nick, “that the
reason for the odd feeling is that we
are so vitally aware of the planet’s
rotation. After all, Earth is no laggard,
either, but it’s so damned big
in comparison to this, and so few
people, relatively have been off it as
yet. What I mean is: if your knowledge
of Hastur’s rotation were strictly
theoretical, or if you hadn’t seen
it from space, the whole thing
wouldn’t appear to you as it does
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The going was just a trifle more
difficult than covering rocky ground
would have been on Earth: Vickers
had figured Hastur’s gravity as 125%
that of Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold it,” called out Edgar, punctuating
the exclamation by easing
himself onto the asteroid’s surface.
“Does anyone know where we’re going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re off to find the Hartnetts,”
said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How nice. And where, pray, may
they be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right here—somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely,” drawled Edgar, “just
lovely. Have any of you stopped to
consider how many days and how
many weary miles you can cover on
this not-as-small-as-it-looks world
without finding anything at all except
blisters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We tried to contact them,” cut
in Nick, “but not a peep out of the
radio at all. The thing just went
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to admit,” continued
Edgar, “that at the very moment I
can’t think of any better procedure
than just striking out in any direction
at once. But I rest assured that
there is a better way. Therefore, I
move that we take it easy until we
find one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could use the ship,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inadvisable,” objected Nick.
“Something tells me we are going to
have trouble getting away from this
little fiend of a planetoid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about rocket cameras?” cut
in Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can make them. We’ll use just
enough fuel to send them up half
a mile or so. They’ll take pictures,
then glide down. We’ll keep an eye
on them and see where they land;
Edgar will also take calculations
while they’re up—they’ll be sort of
periscopic photos. Of course we’ll get
our ship, but we may spot the other
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick tapped the rocky surface
pondering. “Only thing wrong with
that is: why didn’t we see the ship
on the way down? We had a much
bigger perspective.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps too big. Besides we were
too well occupied otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Okay,” sighed Nick. “I can’t see
any reason for not trying it.”</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MENACE UNSEEN</span></h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy clasped Nick’s
hand as firmly as hands can
be clasped when swathed
in space-mitts. “If the photo didn’t
deceive us, the ship should be over
this ridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick nodded, shot an impatient
glance at the others straggling up
the slight incline. Together he and
Dorothy mounted the acclivity,
peered anxiously at the sweep below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little scream of delight came
from Dorothy’s lips, “There, Nick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt about it. The lost Orion
lay, partly concealed by upcroppings
of rock, less than a mile away. Hastily
they made their way down the
decline, ran in awkward, elephantine
steps toward it. As they approached
they could see how beaten and
scarred it looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bounded to the port and
breathlessly clanged upon it. It was
shut tightly. Impatiently they beat
upon it until finally it swooshed open
and they filed into the airlock. Imperturbably
the outer door snapped
close behind them, clamlike, and painfully
slow the inner port dragged itself
open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lost Orion!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air was pure—that they
noticed first of all when they had
doffed cautiously their helmets. Pure
and warm. Quickly they took off
the clumsy suits and looked about
them. No one was in sight; no greeting
came to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” yelled Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not as large as the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>,
this ill-fated craft, but a big ship
nonetheless. Hearts beating out ill
omens, they searched room after
room, finding no one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello! Hello!” cried Dorothy.
Edgar grasped her arm. “Wait,” he
murmured. “I think I heard an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently they followed him, as he
led, to a small room. There was a
bed, a set of controls—from this
point the mechanisms for opening the
double doors had been set in motion—a
small heating unit, and a
large armchair. As their eyes roved
about the room, a figure arose unsteadily
from the chair and faced
them—a tall, gaunt man, white-haired,
his eyes looking as if he had
been lost for a thousand years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wordlessly he stared at them, as
Nick stepped forward, his voice
husky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steve!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The older man looked at him, a
sort of dull bewilderment spreading
across his face. “Hello, Nick,”
he said softly. “I was sort of wondering
when you’d come. Who are
your friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Dorothy Gilbert,” spoke up
that person coming forward, “and I
think I’d better fix something for you
right away, Steve. You look as if
you haven’t had a square meal since
Sinbad went sailing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man grinned wanly.
“Guess I haven’t been eating any too
regularly. Haven’t had much company,
you see since—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about it later,” interrupted
Dorothy. “Edgar, break out
the rations and help me with this
thing. Looks like an old model.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to it,” murmured Vickers.
“I’m Edgar Vickers,” he added
in Hartnett’s direction; “my brother,
Bob, is the slack-mouthed individual
you see behind me. There’s three
other fellows in the party, but they
stayed back in the ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett sat down on the bed, his
eyes wandering from one to another.
“Nice girl you have there, Nick,” he
whispered. “You’re not letting any
of these other lads get the jump on
you, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a chance,” replied Dorothy
without looking up, “I’m after the
Hartnett fortune because there’s no
one else I know who is worth marrying,
even for the kind of lab I
want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you write the book you always
said you would if you were ever
marooned, Steve?” asked Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett nodded. “Guess that’s all
that kept me from going nuts. All
alone here—not strong enough to do
much more than take care of myself,
write, and send signals out.
Didn’t go outside much after—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy faced him, her eyes misty.
“Don’t try to soften it Steve—I knew
as soon as I came in the ship. Harry’s
dead, isn’t he? Like all the others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett nodded. “Yes—like all
the others.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not much to tell,” said
Hartnett slowly, after the meal
had been finished. “We started out
in the Orion much the same as you
did in the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>, tested the contracels
and decided everything was
all right. We noticed this little
world here and landed to investigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only we couldn’t get off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d been going virtually at the
speed of light and that warped the
fourth dimensional fields which were
a basic part of the contracels. We
found that the only way we had of
getting off this planetoid was by
rockets, and rockets weren’t enough.
We just slid along the surface, battered
up the ship, then stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we began to find out things
about this world. Some of them were
interesting, and some—” he broke
off suddenly. “Nick, you or none
of your party have been out without
full suits have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Don’t. This little world is
full of radiations, a good deal of
which are undetectable, but nasty
nonetheless. Seven of our party succumbed
before we suspected anything
was wrong, and five more died within
the next fortnight from perfectly innocent
things which must have acted
as catalysts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far as we know, an ordinary
suit is protection, but we can’t be
sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to the others?”
asked Bob Vickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett was silent for a moment.
“When we landed, one of the rocket
fuel tanks was ruptured. Not broken
open, just cracked enough to let the
stuff vaporize and escape. It started
to flood the ship gradually, before we
found out. We drew lots to see who
would seal off the rooms where it had
already penetrated, knowing that the
chances were a hundred to one that
everyone who went would be blown
up. It was a suicide job, but those
suicides could keep the entire ship
from being blasted to free electrons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did. If you’d come from the
other side, you’d have seen the great
gaping crater and the hole in the
ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” started
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” spoke up Nick. “When the
Orion left, the only rocket fuel which
was any good was HZ 7. It had one
fault, however. Let any atmosphere
get at it and it would vaporize and
seep through practically every known
substance, except wax. And that
vapor was about ten times as touchy
as nitro. When it went off you had
a terrific explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What these fellows did, I take it,
Steve, was to seal off the sections
from the outside, leaving plenty of
room for the vapor to explode, perhaps
calculating on its drawing closer
while they were at work. Then, they
went to work on padding so that the
concussion wouldn’t completely wreck
the ship. Their only chance of escape
was completing the job and
getting off before the stuff lit up.
And working around it was almost
a positive guarantee of setting it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett nodded. “That’s just
about what happened. Three men
were on the job of sealing off. That
was the sure death assignment, because
they would have to be practically
entombed inside. Five others
were on the padding job; they had a
chance of not being smashed to pieces
by the concussion if the blow held off
long enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it didn’t—not quite long
enough. They managed to get their
work almost finished. It was just
the sheerest luck that the thing
didn’t fill the entire ship, or go off
before some of us were out of the
way. That was when we didn’t all
wait to put on full suits—and it
seemed all right outside. Well, the
radiation got the ones who survived
the blast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He buried his face in his hands. “It
seems as if it happened ten years ago
at times, then I feel, sometimes, as if
it had happened yesterday.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy slipped her arm around
him. “It wasn’t your fault.
Come, tell us more—about the things
you found out about this planetoid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his head, brow wrinkled
in concentration. “There’s an odd
effect at the horizon—maybe you
haven’t noticed it yet, eh? The
equator of the world seems to be
moving, flowing along the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yow!” exclaimed Edgar. “Lorentz-Fitzgerald
stuff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simple,” he went on. “The speed
of rotation of this planetoid at the
equator approaches the speed of light,
believe it or not. So the equator
contracts. Its diameter remains the
same, mind you, since it isn’t moving
along the line of the diameter, but
the circumference grows smaller. And
that my friends,” he concluded,
“makes the mathematical ‘pi’ a
variable so far as Hastur is concerned.
Geometry on this planet must
be hot stuff—a veritable purgatory
for mathematicians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the devil did you figure all
that out?” exclaimed Hartnett, a note
of awed admiration in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edgar grinned. “I’m not staking
my life on it,” he said, “but it’s the
only explanation I can think of for
the phenomenon you described.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you may be right, and then
again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The important thing, now,
is to get off Hastur. These radiations
are what got most of us—doesn’t
make too much difference with me,
because I’m old. But I’m assuming,”
he looked at Dorothy and Nick, “that
you two will be wanting to pair off
pretty soon. And I don’t think Dorothy
would care to start knitting little
sweaters with holes for three heads
in them after she’d had x-rays
taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get off,” declared Nick. “Our
rockets are powerful enough, I think.
We’ll take what we can from the
Orion—and I suspect that you and
your book, Steve, will be all—then
scram away from here fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clasped Dorothy’s hand. “I
only want a hole for one head in that
little sweater.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Joe Timbie turned to Hartnett
and Nick with a despairing gesture.
“See? All we do is slide along
the ground. I’ve given her the best
blasts we have and there’s the result.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good thing they’ve found a new
kind of rocket fuel in these last
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dorothy came in, Nick
gripped her hands and clung to her.
There was no need for words. Silently
they looked out of the port onto
the scene of their prison, grey twilight
world with its sky of starlit
black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally he straightened up, reached
out and pressed the call-button which
would summon all hands to the control
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing wrong with the
rocket tubes, or the fuel,” he said
softly when all had come. “Everything
is working as it should work.
Our rockets just aren’t strong enough
to get us off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the contracels?” burst out
Marquis bewilderedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett shook his head. “No
good here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Vickers went over to the window
and looked out, staring at the
landscape as if there lay an answer
to their problem. “Edgar,” he called
after a moment, “are you sure about
what you said about the equator?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No guarantees, but it could very
easily be that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then mightn’t an object at the
equator be thrown off the planet by
centrifugal force?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edgar turned to Nick. “It might—matter
of fact, it should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett bit his lips. “It’s a long
chance,” he said, “but still a chance.
If the ship will hold together under
the terrific punishment it would have
to take, sliding along the ground on
our rocket blasts, then we may be
able to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Okay,” declared Nick. “Everybody
get into space suits, make sure
the air-making apparatus is in order,
and take your stations. We’ve got to
have lookouts covering all sectors to
spot any possible punctures of the
hull. As soon as everybody’s checked
from their posts, Joe, let her rip.”</p>

<div><h2>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ORDEAL</span></h2></div>

<p class='pindent'>They clung to the stanchions,
watching the rocky surface of
Hastur lurch by them, even in
the protection of their suits horribly
jolted by the choppy acceleration.
They clung wondering how long the
<span class='it'>Columbia</span> would stand up under a
type of punishment for which it had
never been designed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something’s wrong,” complained
Timbie. “The fire should take place
so that, to my limited senses it seems
continuous. It isn’t doing that at
all.” He pressed a button. “I can
sense a distinct interval between the
release of the firing apparatus and
the explosion, and another interval
before the reaction shoves us ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at the stars!” cried Bob
Vickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They glanced in the direction of his
pointing finger and gasped. Above
them in the inky blackness were no
longer the tiny pin-points that they
had been seeing so far; they had become
huge globes of multi-colored
light. And there was one immense
thing which visibly swam in the
ether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was more than just that.
Way out beyond the globes, which
looked like glowing baseballs, and
basketballs, they caught a flashing
something. It grew visibly as they
watched, swelled until it seemed that
it must batter its way through the
mass of luminaries around them, send
them in flaming ruin down the surface
of the little world. Huger and
more terrifying it grew, like a movie
closeup, until it filled the entire vista
of the heavens. The light should
have been blinding; it should have
burned out their brains, yet they
could behold it without so much as
being dazzled. Now the size of it
was such that no longer could they
see its full circle, but only a section
of the titanic surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly the smooth aspect of it
faded and sharp prominences began
to appear. It was no perfect sphere,
this body, but a roughly-circular
mass, shot through with enormous
cracks, riddled with holes, jagged
with mountains. One spire-like protuberance
seemed to be pointing directly
at them, aiming itself at the
ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paralyzed with mingled amazement
and terror they stood, bracing themselves
for an impact which would
destroy them utterly, volatilize them
and the ship with such titanic swiftness
that their consciousness would
be obliterated before any sensations
of it could reach them. They would
see the destroyer almost upon them,
and that would be all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were wrong. It screamed
down out of the night of space above
them, not touching their ship, seemingly
a good distance away. No concussion
wave struck them, yet they
saw the surface of Hastur cleft and
crumpled before them, saw the monster
bury itself in the planetoid.
There was a flare of light which made
them blink for an instant, and that
was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Veer away,” gasped Nick. “We
don’t want to be tumbled into that
chasm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Timbie’s fingers darted over the
controls, and they were lurched side-wise
as the <span class='it'>Columbia</span> went off at a
tangent to their former course. The
bewilderment of what they had just
seen still lay upon them; their minds
were numb with the incredibility of
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy’s eyes met Nick’s. “Are we
dead?” she whispered. “Were we all
killed in that collision and is this but
the last flickers of my consciousness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering that, too,” came
Nick’s voice over the space-phones.
“But it couldn’t be so if it occurred
to you, too. There’s some simple explanation
for all this, but for the
life of me, I can’t think what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-oh,” said Timbie. “More fireworks!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Before them loomed a vast cliff
wall, so high that they could
not see its top. It had not been
there an instant before. Somehow,
they could not feel the horror of a
few moments back, yet they braced
themselves again for a shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden jolt wrenched them away
from the stanchions; the ship came to
a stop as a warning light flickered
ominously on the control board. Yet,
as they picked themselves up, the
cliff had disappeared; it was not behind
them, and before them stretched
the familiar surface of Hastur, above
them the velvet of space, flecked with
pinpricks of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A puncture!” cried Nick. He
grabbed the speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nick,” came the voice of Marquis.
“There’s a hole about the size
of a soup plate in sector seven. Don’t
worry; we’ll be sealing it off directly,
and we’ve locked it off. Call you
back when it’s done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Okay, be careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the others. “We’ll
be on our way shortly. Anybody see
that pit we turned off our course to
avoid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s gone, Nick,” said Hartnett,
“but the show’s still on.” He nodded
toward the port.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something was coming over the
horizon, something that looked partly
like an arm, and partly like a molten
river. It was both a flow and a
wriggling, and, as they watched, another
glowing thing snaked up from
behind the distant ridges. This second
thing went straight up into the
sky, curving out as if looking for
something upon which to swoop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the main body of the
thing began to be visible. It was
vaguely conical, with the apex inverted,
the arms of it issuing forth
from the sides. A single glowing eye
bulged from the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks nasty,” said Nick, “but
I don’t think it’s very powerful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might bang us up a bit,
though,” added Timbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beastie is after something.
Look at the way those three arms
are swishing around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing was virtually monochrome
except for the jet black of
the single eye. The arms were flailing
in the general direction of the
ship, coming closer with each cast.
But apparently it had not reached
them yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose it can’t see well?”
asked Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before anyone could answer her
the creature had already acted. For
caught now in one of the brilliant
arms was a flattish many-legged
thing, looking more like a centipede
than anything else. It had a barbed
tail like a scorpion, and was writhing
and trying to spear the other
desperately. But the hunter had calculated
well and encircled its prey
in such a manner that the barb could
not reach it. Closer to the brilliant
body the struggling thing was borne,
then a slit appeared in the side of
the victor, and a deep red orifice
grew. The flattish creature was
popped into this; the cavity closed
with a snap and again the shell of
brilliant cone-thing seemed to be
unbroken.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice fauna here,” remarked Nick.
“Did your party ever meet up with
that beauty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett grinned. “In a way. But
watch closely, now. There’s more to
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright cone rested motionless
on the ridge, two of its three arms
lying motionless. They couldn’t see
the third, but supposed that it, too,
was at rest. Unwinking, the huge
eyes stared apparently upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But off in another direction what
looked like a cloud was approaching.
It drifted easily, dropping to the surface
now and then and lazing along
for a while, then rising up again.
The size of it made them gasp. It
seemed to be larger than the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the cone-thing was aware of
its approach and the bright arms was
in play again. Like a fisherman casting
after trout, the arms threw out.
The cloud came on until it hovered
over the cone-creature, then suddenly
it dropped down enveloping it. An
instant later it rose and the cone-creature
was gone; the whitish cloud
started to drift away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But something was wrong. It
didn’t move as easily as it had done
before; it lurched in a distressed
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong with it?” murmured
Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, it’s changing color,” cried
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rusty stain had suddenly appeared
in the cloud. Before their
eyes it grew rapidly, the core of it
an angry red, the spreading stain
rust. The cloud-thing rose up slowly,
but the red spot grew. And as
they watched, a bulge appeared in
the red, grew like a blister and finally
burst. From the cavity the brilliant
arms of the cone-thing appeared,
followed by the rest of the
creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lingered in the opening as the
stricken cloud sank slowly to the
surface of the planetoid. Now the
red stain had almost completely
blotted out the normal white of the
cloud and they saw that the thing
was beginning to crumble where the
cone-creature had emerged. It dissolved
into a sort of dust leaving the
cone-thing in much the same position
it had been in before, with the single
great eye staring up at the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be damned,” murmured Nick.
“It must have poisoned the cloud.
But why did the cloud try to eat it,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These creatures haven’t any intelligence
at all, apparently,” explained
Hartnett. “I’ve seen that happen any
number of times. I’d say offhand
that the cloud-mass is attracted by
something in the cone-creature—perhaps
that scorpion-thing it just ate,
because the clouds can envelope them
without danger. But the cone-creature
is rather well developed as you
saw.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The light on the control board
winked. Timbie picked up the
phone. “It’s Marquis,” he said.
“They’ve got the patch on the puncture
and we’ll be able to go ahead
shortly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Okay,” said Nick. “Tell them to
wink when all’s ready.” He turned
to the others. “It doesn’t look as if
we’ll make the equator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett smiled grimly. “Well, if
we can’t get off, we can at least
gather some valuable data here on
such things as the Doppler effect,
the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction
effect, the Einstein effect——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey!” burst in Dorothy, “did you
say Einstein?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. This will be the
first opportunity anyone’s ever had
to get real observational data for
primary sources.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” she continued.
“According to Einstein, there’s an
increase in mass with an increase in
speed, isn’t there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct, but why get so excited
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots of reasons, Nick. We’re
dopes, that’s why. There’s no sense
in our going to the equator; our mass
would be so terrific there that we
could never get off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, if there’s a point where the
centrifugal force will throw us off,
it’s between here and the equator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s right!” screamed Edgar.
“And I’m a seventh order moron not
to have thought of it myself. If
such a point exists, we must be
pretty close to it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light flickered again. “All set,”
said Joe. “Get ready; we’re moving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again they grasped the stanchions,
their hearts hammering in hopeful
anticipation. Now the effect that
Timbie had mentioned was painfully
apparent. They saw him press the
firing button, counted beneath their
breath as they waited for the light
which would indicate that the rocket
had fired correctly—ordinarily, that
light flicked so soon after the button
was pressed that it appeared simultaneous—then
braced themselves for
a spurt ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it came the scene outside had
altered again. Now the entire topography
of Hastur seemed to be a
vast concavity and they were climbing
up the rim of the great cup.
Ahead of them strange wrinkles appeared
in the surface which became
normal again as they approached
nearer; behind them, the planetoid
had become an incline sloping down
to the edge where the great globes of
stars wheeled in the abyss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we crazy—or is it Hastur?”
burst out Bob Vickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett smiled. “These distortions
are purely illusionary. It’s the
effect of the rotation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, strangely slow, the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>
dragged itself forward, sliding
along the planetoid’s surface, more
fantastically distorted to their eyes
every instant. Now it seemed to
shrink before them until it appeared
that the entire world was smaller
than their ship, that the <span class='it'>Columbia</span>
was balancing precariously on the
ridiculous little globe of it, and the
first spurt from the rockets would
send them off into space. Then
Hastur was an incredible long, winding
ribbon, lined with impassable
mountains on either side, and they
must travel along the millions of
miles of it, as on a runway until at
last they came to the rim. Then
it was a geometrical nightmare, a
riot of planes and angles which hurt
their eyes to see; up from the surface
reared hideously formed ridges
and equally ghastly orifices yawned
before them. And before them
stretched leagues upon leagues of
glassy surface.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weird terrain was slipping
away from them; they felt themselves
buffeted as the entire ship
was rocked violently. “We’ve hit it,”
yelled Bob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below them Hastur was already a
sphere, and, as Timbie’s fingers
pressed buttons releasing full fire on
the rockets, it became again the incredible
globe they had seen when
approaching it. They were free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy raised her hand to her
face to wipe away a tear that was
streaming down her cheek, smiled despite
herself when her mailed finger
touched the glassite of her helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goodbye, Harry,” she whispered.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“We have here,” declared
Edgar, picking his nose, “a
small list of the mysteries of Hastur.
So far as I can see, the only way
really to break them is to make up
another expedition sometime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read ’em off, bucko,” said Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First of all—what is Hastur made
of? Why, with the terrific speed of
rotation, doesn’t it fly to pieces?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I devoted five pages to that in
my book,” put in Hartnett. “To sum
up briefly: there’s no reason I know
why it should be, but it is. Therefore,
there must be a reason.” They
glared at him. “Good way of wasting
time,” he protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” continued Edgar, “we have
the matter of the reverse English
radio reception. And I shall personally
slay and dismember anyone
who tries to pass it off merely as
‘Einstein effect’.” He looked up.
“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dorothy smiled. “We like living,
Edgar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking of ‘Einstein effect’,”
broke in Hartnett, “I presume you
realize by now that all the weird
things we saw were enormously distorted.
The stars, for example, were
never actually closer. That was easy
to realize, because no more than the
customary amount of light was visible,
and no gravitational eccentricities
were noted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the thing that nearly
wiped us out?” asked Bob Vickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A meteor—and a very small one
at that. It landed a little distance
away from the ship. Had it hit us,
it wouldn’t have blotted us out, but
could have caused considerable damage
nonetheless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the—creatures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Microscopic. Had we been able
to move at the time, we could have
ploughed right through them. I’ve
seen those illusions a number of
times—we wasted quite a bit of ammunition
on them before we got wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And just imagine their consternation
when they saw us, apparently
microscopic, too, yet always out of
grasp. That’s why the cone-creature
was flailing away at nothing at all.
It was trying to catch us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you explain wave n?” burst
in Edgar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seven pages on that in my
book,” smiled Hartnett. “Summed
up, I say: wave n was discovered
while we were looking for something
else. We played around with it until
it began to sit up and say ‘uncle.’
We don’t know from nothing about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick puzzled. “What kind of a
book is this, Steve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hartnett laughed. “A joke. A
beautiful joke on the dear public.
Three hundred pages of pompous
drivel, harebrained speculations,
pseudo-science, and what not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a solemn vow many years
ago, Nick, that if I ever became an
explorer, I would write a book to end
all travel books, in retaliation for the
ghastly piles of dung about which
pedants rave so heartily and which
are crammed down the throats of
otherwise innocent schoolboys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here on Hastur I had the time
to do it—and it was a good way of
keeping my spirits up. Oh yes—I
worked on solid stuff, too—but that
isn’t for public consumption; too
deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But seriously,” broke in Edgar,
“haven’t you any idea as to the reason
for the signals in reverse English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to be personally slain
and dismembered, Edgar. That tabu
explanation very frankly is the only
one I’ve found so far. The signals
were warped—unless you want something
utterly fantastic like their
traveling around the universe, or being
slipped through the continuum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that mean?” asked
Dorothy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. It’s a sort of gibberish
which some people use to explain
things otherwise inexplicable.” He
paused as the familiar figure of Grenville,
wreathed with beatific smiles,
entered the room. “What’s in the
bottle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have here,” sighed the chemical
engineer, “the ne-plus-ultra of our
own private rocket-blast. It’s
smooth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah? What happened to your
fingernails?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got hungry!—Okay, if you don’t
trust me, I’ll sample it first.” He uncorked
the bottle and took a mighty
quaff of the curiously-colored contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he starts rolling over on the
floor, kicking feebly, we’ll know that
it’s a good roach spray if nothing
else,” observed Edgar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastur was behind them now; soon
the contracels would be flashing them
back to Earth. Dorothy drew close
to Nick, glad that the cumbersome
suits were no longer necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be a little blue sweater,
she thought, just for luck.</p>
